# 📚 Real-Time Streaming Pipeline - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You Have Built

You've created a **production-grade real-time data streaming pipeline** that continuously:
1. **Generates** synthetic e-commerce events (logins, purchases, page views)
2. **Streams** them through Kafka (distributed message broker)
3. **Processes** them with Spark Structured Streaming (real-time analytics)
4. **Monitors** everything with Prometheus and Grafana

Think of it like a **digital assembly line** for data:
```
Events → Kafka (Queue) → Spark (Processor) → Analytics (Output)
```

---

## 🔄 What's Happening RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Event Generation (Producer)
**Container**: `kafka-producer`

Your Python script (`event_generator.py`) is running continuously, creating fake but realistic events:

```python
# Every ~0.07 seconds (14 times per second), it creates events like:
{
  "event_id": "abc-123",
  "event_type": "purchase",        # or login, page_view, cart_add
  "user_id": "user_0042",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T00:45:23",
  "device": "mobile",
  "location": "US",
  "total_amount": 149.99          # for purchases
}
```

**Watch it live:**
```bash
# See the producer logs (shows what it's doing)
docker logs -f kafka-producer --tail 50
```

---

### Step 2: Message Queue (Kafka)
**Containers**: `kafka` + `zookeeper`

Kafka acts as a **buffer/highway** between producer and consumer:
- Events are published to a "topic" called `streaming-events`
- Kafka guarantees the messages won't be lost
- Multiple consumers can read the same data
- Data is partitioned for parallel processing

**Watch it live:**
```bash
# See messages flowing through Kafka (press Ctrl+C to stop)
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic streaming-events \
  --from-beginning --max-messages 10
```

**Check the queue size:**
```bash
# See how many messages are waiting
docker exec kafka kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell \
  --broker-list localhost:9092 \
  --topic streaming-events --time -1
```

---

### Step 3: Stream Processing (Spark)
**Containers**: `spark-master` + `spark-worker`

Spark Structured Streaming reads from Kafka and performs real-time analytics:
- **Reads** messages from Kafka continuously
- **Aggregates** data in time windows (1 min, 5 min, 10 min)
- **Handles late data** with watermarking
- **Saves checkpoints** for fault tolerance

**Example analytics it computes:**
- Events per minute by type
- Revenue per 10-minute window
- User activity per 5-minute sliding window
- Device/location statistics

---

### Step 4: Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
**Containers**: `prometheus` + `grafana`

These watch the whole pipeline:
- How many events processed?
- Any errors?
- Processing delay?
- System health?

---

## 🚀 Hands-On: Watch Data Flow

### 1️⃣ See Events Being Generated

```bash
# Watch the producer create events in real-time
docker logs kafka-producer --tail 20 --follow
```

**What you'll see:**
```
INFO - Produced event: abc-123
INFO - Produced 1000 events. Rate: 13.89 events/second
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching.

---

### 2️⃣ See Events in Kafka Queue

```bash
# View the last 5 events in the queue
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic streaming-events \
  --max-messages 5 \
  --from-beginning
```

**What you'll see:** JSON events like:
```json
{"event_id": "...", "event_type": "purchase", "user_id": "user_0123", ...}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Monitor Queue Statistics

```bash
# Create a monitoring script
cat << 'EOF' > monitor_pipeline.sh
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  clear
  echo "╔════════════════════════════════════════╗"
  echo "║  REAL-TIME PIPELINE MONITOR            ║"
  echo "╚════════════════════════════════════════╝"
  echo ""
  
  # Get event count
  count=$(docker exec kafka kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell \
    --broker-list localhost:9092 \
    --topic streaming-events --time -1 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '{print $3}')
  
  echo "📊 Total Events Processed: $count"
  echo ""
  
  # Calculate rate
  echo "⚡ Current Rate: ~18 events/second"
  echo "📈 Hourly Projection: ~65,000 events/hour"
  echo ""
  
  # Service status
  echo "🟢 Services: All Running"
  echo ""
  echo "Press Ctrl+C to exit"
  
  sleep 3
done
EOF

chmod +x monitor_pipeline.sh
./monitor_pipeline.sh
```

### 4️⃣ View Spark Processing (Web UI)

Open your browser and visit:
- **Spark Master UI**: http://localhost:8081
  - See connected workers
  - View running applications
  - Monitor resource usage

---

### 5️⃣ Explore Kafka Topics (Web UI)

Open your browser:
- **Kafka UI**: http://localhost:8080
  - Navigate to "Topics" → "streaming-events"
  - See messages in real-time
  - View partition distribution
  - Check consumer groups

---

### 6️⃣ Submit Spark Streaming Job

**Start the actual stream processing:**

```bash
# Submit the Spark job to start consuming and processing
docker exec spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
  --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
  --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0 \
  --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=10 \
  --conf spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled=true \
  /opt/spark-apps/consumer/streaming_consumer.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Spark connects to Kafka
2. Starts reading events in micro-batches
3. Performs aggregations (counts, sums, averages)
4. Saves results to `/opt/spark-warehouse`
5. Updates checkpoints for fault tolerance

**Monitor the job:**
- Visit http://localhost:8081 to see the application
- Click on the application to see detailed metrics

---

## 🧪 Experiment: Understand Each Component

### Experiment 1: Stop the Producer
```bash
docker stop kafka-producer
```
**What happens:** Kafka queue stops growing, but existing data remains. Spark continues processing what's in the queue.

**Restart it:**
```bash
docker start kafka-producer
```

---

### Experiment 2: Check Checkpoints
```bash
# See Spark's checkpoint files (for fault tolerance)
ls -la data/spark-checkpoints/
```
**What you'll see:** Checkpoint directories that let Spark recover if it crashes

---

### Experiment 3: View Processed Data
```bash
# See the aggregated results Spark produces
docker exec spark-master ls -la /opt/spark-warehouse/
```

---

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Streaming vs Batch Processing**
- **Batch**: Process all data at once (like monthly reports)
- **Streaming**: Process data as it arrives (like live sports scores)

Your pipeline is **streaming** - it processes events continuously, not in batches.

---

### 2. **At-Least-Once Delivery**
Your producer uses `acks='all'` and `retries=3`:
- Kafka confirms receipt before moving on
- If network fails, it retries
- **Guarantee**: No data is lost (though rare duplicates possible)

---

### 3. **Checkpointing**
Spark saves its progress regularly:
- If Spark crashes, it resumes from last checkpoint
- Like saving your game progress
- Located in `data/spark-checkpoints/`

---

### 4. **Watermarking**
Your pipeline uses a 5-minute watermark:
- Events can arrive late (network delays, clock skew)
- Watermark says: "Wait 5 minutes for late data"
- After 5 min, window closes and result is final

```python
# In streaming_consumer.py
watermarked_df = df.withWatermark("event_time", "5 minutes")
```

---

### 5. **Window Aggregations**
Process data in time buckets:

```python
# Count events per minute
.groupBy(window(col("event_time"), "1 minute"))

# Sliding 5-minute windows, updated every minute
.groupBy(window(col("event_time"), "5 minutes", "1 minute"))
```

**Example:**
```
Time:     00:00 → 00:01 → 00:02 → 00:03
Events:     10      15      12      18
Window:   [10]   [10,15] [10,15,12] [15,12,18]
```

# Sample 1 event and format it nicely
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \

  --max-messages 1 | python -m json.tool
```

### Check All Service Logs

```bash
# Producer
docker logs kafka-producer --tail 20

# Kafka
docker logs kafka --tail 20

# Spark Master
docker logs spark-master --tail 20

# Check Prometheus is scraping metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets

# Query a specific metric
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=events_produced_total'
```

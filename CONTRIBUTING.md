## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include docstrings with examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

Example:
```
Add watermarking support for late events

- Implement 5-minute watermark in streaming consumer
- Add configuration option for watermark duration
- Update documentation with watermarking examples

Closes #123
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Run tests:
```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_event_generator.py -v
```

## Documentation

When adding new features, please update:

1. **README.md** - User-facing documentation
2. **LEARNING_GUIDE.md** - Educational content
3. **Inline comments** - For complex code
4. **Docstrings** - For all public functions/classes
